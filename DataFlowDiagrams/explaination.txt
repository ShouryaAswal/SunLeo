DFD Explanation (YouTube-to-MP3 Application)

Level 0 (Context)
- Single process: "YouTube-to-MP3 System".
- External entities: User, YouTube, Identity Provider (optional), Metadata DB (data store).
- Inputs: Search/Chat/URL/Convert requests from User.
- Outputs: Results/Status/MP3 to User.
- External interactions: Search/Metadata with YouTube; Auth tokens with Identity Provider.
- Data store: Metadata DB for download history and recommendations (no MP3 storage).

Level 1 (Decomposition)
1. Web UI: Collects user input, shows results and job status, triggers download.
2. Chatbot Orchestrator: Interprets user intent and routes to search or conversion.
3. Search Service: Uses YouTube Data API for search/metadata.
4. Link Resolver: Validates URL and extracts video_id.
5. Conversion Orchestrator: Creates jobs, enqueues, updates status, writes metadata.
6. In-Memory Job Queue: Holds jobs; limits concurrency (free, demo-safe).
7. Conversion Worker: Downloads via yt-dlp, converts via ffmpeg, reports status.
8. File Delivery: Streams the MP3 back to the user from local downloads.
9. Notification Service: Pushes job status updates to the UI.
D1. Metadata DB: Stores user download history for recommendations.

Notes
- Conversion runs on backend; browser only sends requests and receives results.
- MP3 files are stored locally in downloads/ and served directly; no S3 used.
- Queue is in-memory for zero cost; can be replaced by Redis later.
